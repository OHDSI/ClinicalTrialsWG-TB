    description: The PAYER_PLAN_PERIOD table captures details of the period of time that a Person is continuously
      enrolled under a specific health Plan benefit structure from a given Payer. Each Person receiving
      healthcare is typically covered by a health benefit plan, which pays for (fully or partially), or
      directly provides, the care. These benefit plans are provided by payers, such as health insurances
      or state or government agencies. In each plan the details of the health benefits are defined for
      the Person or her family, and the health benefit Plan might change over time typically with increasing
      utilization (reaching certain cost thresholds such as deductibles), plan availability and purchasing
      choices of the Person. The unique combinations of Payer organizations, health benefit Plans and
      time periods in which they are valid for a Person are recorded in this table.
